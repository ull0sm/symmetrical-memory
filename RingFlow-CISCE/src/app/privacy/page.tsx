        <Section title="What we collect">
          <p>
            Only what is necessary to run a tournament: event name, schedule, bracket data, participant names,
            weight classes, and round results entered by the event administrator. Admin and moderator credentials
            are stored as one-way hashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not collect payment information, government IDs, or any sensitive personal data.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="How long we keep it">
          <p>
            Data is scoped entirely to the lifetime of an event. When an event is marked complete, all associated
            data - participants, brackets, results - is permanently deleted. Nothing is archived or retained.
          </p>
          <p>
            RingFlow is built to be ephemeral. That is not a caveat; it is the point.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Third-party services">
          <p>
            Data is stored in the event's own PostgreSQL database. We use Cloudflare Turnstile (when enabled) for bot protection on
            public forms. Turnstile does not fingerprint users. The app runs on the organiser's own server (a venue machine or a cloud host). Each service operates
            under its own privacy policy.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Cookies">
          <p>
            Session cookies only, for authentication. No advertising cookies, no cross-site tracking, no
            analytics that profile individual users.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Your rights">
          <p>
            You can request a copy of any personal data we hold, ask us to correct it, or ask us to delete it.
            In most cases your data has already been deleted automatically. Email{" "}
